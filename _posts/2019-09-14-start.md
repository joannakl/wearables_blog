This project was inspired by the Special Session titled
[Teaching “Blinky Flashy”:​ ​Best Practices and Helpful Tips for Teaching eTextiles to a Wide Range of Students](https://easychair.org/smart-program/SIGCSE2018/2018-02-22.html#talk:61740) that I attended at SIGCSE '18 conference. The session was run by [Gina Likins](https://twitter.com/lintqueen) from RedHat.
