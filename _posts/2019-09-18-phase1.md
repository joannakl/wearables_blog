## Phase One Goals

The phase one of this project uses exactly the same hardware that Gina gave
us for the workshop at SIGCSCE (the list is replicated below).

The goal for this part of the project is to:
- make sure that everybody can handle working with a needle and thread
- make sure that we can all assemble a basic circuit
- and make sure that the hardware works


## Simple Hardware for Phase One

The parts and tools required were:

## My Design


I used my LEDs and the battery pack to design a crocheted pendant.

I used black yarn to crochet two small disks. The disk were sewn together leaving a small opening at the top. This is where the battery pack is hiding.
The rainbow LEDs were sewn around the perimeter with the + sign along the outer edge.

The thicker black yarn makes it easy to _hide_ the conductive thread connecting the LEDs and the battery pack.

Once the pendant was assembled and the battery was in, I discovered that turning it _backwards_ gives a really cool rainbow glow effect.
