title: Phase Two

## Phase Two Goals

The phase two of this project involves working with a simple microcontroller
and change its default pre-programmed behavior.

The goal for this part of the project is to:
- install and get familiar with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)  
- make sure that we can connect the microcontroller to a computer via USB and
have it recognized by the Arduino IDE
- assemble another simple circuit
- come up with an interesting pattern of lights and program the microcontroller

We are going to follow the steps outlines in [Re-Programming the LilyTiny / LilyTwinkle ](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/re-programming-the-lilytiny--lilytwinkle)

## Hardware for Phase Two

The parts and tools required were:
